Well as the name implies this is a media library for .swf files, I originally made it as a way to replay my childhood games and for those who have really bad laptops, do what ever you want with it but always give credits and don't monetize from it

i would love for anyone to polish it as i'm  not a good programmer, thank you for using my software ^_^
